January, 21st 2014	I modified the user manual. Now it explains briefly how to use Nemoh in
			Matlab. Also it is now specified that the code is supposed to be run in win32
 			environment, and there are some words about mesh generation and format.

January, 24th 2014	Bug correction in Nemoh.m The input variable dir (wave direction) was
			overwritten with the directory variable dir. Correction: now the directory 
			variable is called rep. Bug spotted by Francesco Ferri from Aalborg University 
			in Denmark.
 Thanks Francesco.
